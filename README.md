# Movies-ETL
## Purpose of this Analysis:
In this challenge, we were utilizing our knowledge of database Extraction, Transformation and Load, as well as our knowledge of SQL and Python. We learned how to get data from Kaggle.com. We then cleaned the data as per our need. We were given a format of code, and we had to refactor the code from the module to create a function that takes in the three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data, and perform the Extract, Transform, Load process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database. We sorted the data files in the resources folder and made a Postgres database with tables. We took screenshots of the queries we ran on the database tables and attached them to our resources folder for final submission. In this challenge, we prepared 4 Deliverables: ETL_function_test, ETL_clean_Kaggle_data, ETL_clean_wiki_data and ETL_create_database. We also made sure that the ratings database has 26,024,289 rows and the movies database has 6,052 rows of data. The pictures of the queries performed are shown below:
